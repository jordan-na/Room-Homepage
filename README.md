## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- ES6 module patterns with IIEF's

### What I learned

-  Non-technical skills:

   -  Creating smaller sub goals to finish overall project
   -  Creative design, coming up with a responsive UI that is aesthetically pleasing
   -  Ability to plan and stick to a work schedule with an estimated date of completion
   -  Perserverance to finish the task, even through challenging times
   -  Creating a project not only through the eyes of a developer, but through the eyes of a consumer
      -  Helped me tweak certain features to be mroe user friendly

-  Technical skills:
   -  Responsive UI/UX development
      -  Using the chrome inspector to emulate different screen sizes
   -  Using CSS grid to create responsive and dynamic layouts
   -  CSS media queries
   -  Module design patterns to allow code reusability, organization, and readability
      -  *event-handler.mjs*: Responsible for setting up events
      -  *data-transition.mjs*: Responsible for transitioning to new data on main page
      -  *navigation-controller.mjs*: Reponsible for all logic related to the ui of navigation

### Continued development

-  I will continue to refine my vanilla JS and no-framwork CSS approach before moving onto libraries/frameworks
-  After I have complete a multitude of no library/framework projects, I will learn _React_ and implement it with my knowledge of _Node.js_ and _Express.js_
- Eventually, the goal is to complete a full stack web app that has a use for society

### Useful resources

-  [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - This helped me by acting as a reference for the built in js API
-  [Local Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - I referred to the documentation to use the Local Storage API
